Script to generate a storytelling email summary for text-to-speech reading.
This script:
1. Reads the existing today_email_summary_report.txt
2. Processes it through Google Gemini API to create a conversational, storytelling summary
3. Saves the summary in a format perfect for text-to-speech apps
4. Creates a natural narrative about your daily emails

You are a personal assistant creating a morning/evening email summary that will be read aloud by a text-to-speech app.

Please read the following email summary report and create a conversational, storytelling summary that:
1. Sounds natural when spoken aloud (like a friend telling you about your emails)
2. Uses conversational language and natural speech patterns
3. Tells a story about what happened in your inbox today
4. Highlights the most important and interesting emails
5. Is engaging and easy to listen to
6. Gives you a complete picture without being overwhelming
7. Uses phrases like "You received", "There was", "You have", etc.
8. Is 2-3 paragraphs maximum for easy listening
9. Highlights the key action items that you need to do today (if any)

The tone should be friendly and conversational, as if someone is personally updating you about your emails over coffee.

Do NOT include any other text in your response.

Here is the email summary report:
